Version 1.1.0 (unreleased)
=============
- replacements for inline equations and math parts in displayed equations
  rotate from given collections;
  this avoids unnecessary warnings due to word repetition;
  missing interpunction / operators can be detected as before
- see file 'Example' and LAB:EQUATIONS in the script for summary of operation
- (for German LanguageTool, moving from fixed '$$' and '§§' replacement
  to this scheme detected a few more shortcomings in the 'text under test')

Release 1.0.1
=============
- fixed bug: in equations, trailing space r'\ ' of math parts was
  not recognized;
  also understand \mbox{} in front of an operator (additionally to {})

Release 1.0.0
=============
- added collection 'parms.project_macros' for project-specific macros,
  renamed 'parms.the_macros' to 'parms.system_macros'
- added helper Simple() for declaration of macros without arguments
- macro names end at digits; for instance, \to0 is correctly recognized
  as equivalent with \to 0 (this was a bug)

Release 0.2.0
=============
- more flexible declaration of macros / environments with tailored treatment
- recognize \[ ... \] displayed equations
- only delete environment \begin{...} with option or argument, if declared
  (was a bit sloppy before)
- check nesting depths of {} braces, [] brackets, and environments
- warnings / errors will print a mark to be found by the language checker

Release 0.1.0
=============
- added templates for macros with 2 and 3 arguments to be ignored or
  with last argument to be kept
- \LTskip, \item without [], and \newcommand{}[]{} won't leave blank line
- corrected some typos in comments

Initial Version
===============
